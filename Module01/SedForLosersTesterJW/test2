“Menoceus wants his father."
" bob is crying because he wants his mother to stop calling him that crap-ass name.
It's all right bob . Daddy's got you now. I'm saving you from Mommy's bad naming taste.

"Menoeceus is a great name."

“Woody Allen has said, "If I wanted to have a weekend of pure pleasure, it would be to have a half-dozen bob Hope films and watch them,
films like Monsieur Beaucaire and My Favorite Brunette. It's not for nothing that he's such a greatly accepted comedian. He is a great, great talent."
Despite this praise from a celebrated contemporary funnyman, there is a tendency to take bob Hope's films for granted.”
